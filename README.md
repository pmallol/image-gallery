#### To improve:

- Update the url whenever the user clicks on a pagination button or next/prev image button inside lightbox.
- Add a nice loading indicator when fetching images.
- Make the `Share` button inside lightbox share the gallery url instead of image url.
- Images flicker when loading.
- Animated transitions.
- Custom Lightbox.
- Separate gallery and image preview into their own components.
